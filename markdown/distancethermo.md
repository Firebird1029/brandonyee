# Distance Thermometer

**Stack**: Node.js, Express, Vue, MongoDB, Auth0, Sendgrid, Cloudinary, Azure

This project consisted of a hardware component (written in C and Python code), a backend (Node.js, Express, MongoDB), and a frontend (Vue). By creating a REST API with Express, I could send temperature data from a physical thermometer and store the data in the MongoDB database, along with transmitting it to a web client (such as a manager) via a websocket. Creating an API also allowed other developers, such as a mobile developer, to authenticate a user and access the data.

<!-- - Vue CLI, Vuex to manage state, Vue router + history to handle frontend URL routing
  -scoped styling
- Auth0 SPA, Passport
  - authentication guard for protected routes
- Sendgrid API
- Axios, Formidable
- Cloudinary

- Face API

  - browser's access to media devices, such as the webcam video stream
  - continuous snapshot of video stream to simulate a "live" facial recognition program
- Camera.vue:117-136
- Vue lifecycle hooks to automatically clear the continuous interval on being destroyed

- employers could upload pictures (such as ID pictures) into the system, where it would get loaded into Azure and Azure would process and train the data for facial detection and identification
  - handle file size uploads,
- websocket
- Bulma, Buefy
- MongoDB, Mongoose
- Express routing, order matters, especially with the connect-history-api-fallback needed for Vue
- Breaking down each screen into Vue components, including nested components -->
